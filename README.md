This project focuses on analyzing customer financial data to understand and predict credit scores. The goal is to help financial teams identify high-risk customers, improve credit assessment, and support better lending decisions.

Using the provided dataset, the project builds a clean and simple Power BI dashboard that shows credit score distribution, income segments, utilization patterns, and key customer metrics. These insights help in making data-driven decisions, reducing default risk, and offering the right financial products to customers.
